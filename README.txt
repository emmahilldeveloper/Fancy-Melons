I created Fancy Melons, a web application that allows users to book fancy melon tastings.

I have a Flask/Python backend, use PostgreSQL to store data, and use asynochronous Javascript to load tasting 
options based on search filter JSON data.

If I had more time, I'd spend more time styling the views and trying to get Fancy Melons deployed via Heroku.
I initially got the web application to deploy but had a hard time with Heroku handling my database. So the web
application was basically non-functional without the database access.
